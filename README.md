**Hi, I am Dani.**
* I am a freelance software engineer. Interested in backends, but fullstack by accident.
* Did you know that you can hire me for your next project or idea? Check out [danirod.dev][ddev] for more information.
* I have a blog / website at [danirod.es][danirod] where I want about things of my interest.
* I also work as a content creator for my online projects: [makigas][makigas] and its side [YouTube channel][makigasyt].
* You can find me on [LinkedIn][linkedin], [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] and [Mastodon][mastodon].

**Here are some of my personal programming facts.**
* My favourite languages are C, Go and Ruby. I also enjoy Java and PHP. I am interested in Elixir.
* I really hate JavaScript, but it pays the bills, so I do my best to get the job done (and, if possible, with TypeScript).
* Svelte > Vue > jQuery > React. However, I prefer Nuxt for fullstack JavaScript apps.
* Atomic CSS is a mistake that mankind will eventually pay for. However, in this house we respect [UnoCSS].

**Here are some of the repositories in this profile I think you will probably like.**
* My [dotfiles][dotfiles], my [vimrc][vimrc] and my [Arch Linux install scripts][archinstall].
* My [old x86 operating system][nativeos] and my [new x86-64 operating system][nuts].
* Some of the code I've written in Go include [a timetracker for Redmine][redtime] and [a Twitch stream info editor][streamtitle].
* That time when I wrote a [CHIP-8 emulator][chip8] and a [Game Boy ROM][minesweeper].
* Or that time when [I made a game][rectball] in libGDX and published it on the [Google Play Store][rbplay].
* Those other times where I participated in the libGDX Jam: [here][signal] and [here][axolotl].
